This cookbook is a sample for the [Chef-Jenkins-Library](https://github.com/jmassardo/Chef-Jenkins-Library) project.

It serves two purposes:

* First, it is the main cookbook for the [Chef-Lab-Vagrant](https://github.com/jmassardo/Chef-Lab-Vagrant) and [Chef-Lab-Terraform](https://github.com/jmassardo/Chef-Lab-Terraform) lab hydration projects. It sets the basic stuff like chef-client intervals and audit profiles.
* Second, it provides a cookbook to demo the Jenkins pipelining process.
